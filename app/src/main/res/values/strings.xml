Clicking a tile assigns your colour to it and awards you 3 points on that tile. Subsequent Turns: After the first turn, players can only click on tiles that already have their own colour. Clicking a tile with your colour adds 1 point to that tile.The background colour indicates the next player. Conquest and Expansion: When a tile with your colour reaches 4 points, it triggers an expansion: The colour completely disappears from the original tile. Your colour spreads to the four surrounding squares in a plus shape (up, down, left, right). Each of the four surrounding squares gains 1 point with your colour. If any of the four has your opponentâ€™s colour, you conquer the opponent\'s points on that tile while adding a point to it, completely erasing theirs. The expansion is retriggered if the neighbouring tile as well reaches 4 points this way. Players take turns clicking on tiles and the objective is to eliminate your opponent\'s colour entirely from the screen. User is Supposed to choose the Number of Players,provide names,and select their interested GridSizes making the Game Interactive.Enjoy the Game!!</string>
